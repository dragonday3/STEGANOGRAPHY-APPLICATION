# Secure Data Hiding in Image using Steganography
A PyQt6 Application for Securely Embedding and Extracting Text from Images

**Overview**
This project is a PyQt6-based desktop application that allows users to encrypt and decrypt text within images. It provides a user-friendly interface for embedding text inside images securely and retrieving it when needed. The encryption process modifies pixel values to encode text, ensuring a hidden yet retrievable message.
